# PheEWAS_paper
Files and code used for the PheEWAS manuscript. Note the three files discovery_catbin_finalexp.txt, discovery_cont_phenotype_exp.txt, and phenotype_vars.txt are QC'ed and data type organized files used for this study.

The Code folder holds all code used for QC and analysis and result_files_code has my code I used to create figures and the files for those figures.
